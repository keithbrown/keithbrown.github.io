          <p>
I'm a software developer by day.  I've been very fortunate to work with great people throughout 
my career, both co-workers and customers. I've worked with a wide array of technologies in both 
closed-source and open-source software.
<br><br>
I've been blessed in my job to also travel to Europe a few times.  I've visited Hungary, Denmark, 
Sweden, and England. 
<br><br>
At home I enjoy the outdoors. I'm involved in scouting organizations with both my sons and daughters.
I've camped in numerous places in the Midwest.  While backpacking I've done a 4 day section hike on 
the Appalachain Trail, a 5 day hike at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in the Michigan U.P. and
shorter hikes in Indiana. 
<br><br>
I enjoy fishing, mostly for largemouth bass, when I can make time.
<br><br>
I also enjoy reading and being an active parent in my kids' activities.
